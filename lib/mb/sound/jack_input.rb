    # An audio input stream that opens the `jack-stdout` command in a pipe and
    # reads 32-bit little-endian float data from it, for recording directly
    # from a jackd audio network.
    #
    # Note: as a starting point, set the buffer size equal to the hop size used
    # in any processing algorithms.  This needs to be at least one half of the
    # jackd period size.  The jack-stdout internal buffer will be set larger to
    # handle jitter in processing time.
    #
    # You should use mb-sound-jackffi instead if you can.
    class JackInput < MB::Sound::IOInput
      attr_reader :ports, :sample_rate

      # Initializes a JACK input stream for the given list of port names (pass
      # `nil` to try to leave a port disconnected; this will give a nonexistent
      # port name to jack-stdout for connection).  Alternatively, you can pass an
      # integer for +ports+ to allocate that many disconnected ports.  Uses
      # 4x the given buffer size.
      #
      # The sample rate given should match whatever rate jackd is using.
      #
      # Note: as a starting point, set the buffer size equal to the hop size
      # used in any processing algorithms.  This needs to be at least twice the
      # jackd buffer size.
      #
      # Examples:
      #
      # Recording from the first two system input channels:
      #     MB::Sound::JackInput.new(ports: ['system:capture_1', 'system:capture_2']
      #
      # Creating 8 unconnected input ports:
      #     MB::Sound::JackInput.new(ports: 8)
      #
      # Connecting to either the system input ports, or to ports with prefix
      # specified by the INPUT_DEVICE or DEVICE environment variable
      # (environment variables override the +device:+ key):
      #     # Will default to the system capture ports if the env vars are not set
      #     MB::Sound::JackOutput.new(ports: { device: nil, count: 8 })
      #
      #     # Will connect to ZynAddSubFX, if it's running
      #     ENV['INPUT_DEVICE'] = 'zynaddsubfx:out_'
      #     MB::Sound::JackInput.new(ports: { device: nil, count: 2 })
