    # A 1D circular buffer implemented around Numo::SFloat, Numo::DFloat,
    # Numo::SComplex, or Numo::DComplex, supporting reads and writes of
    # arbitrary sizes.  Also supports multiple readers with different offsets,
    # useful for fanout or delays.
    #
    # Single-reader example:
    #
    #     cbuf = MB::Sound::CircularBuffer.new(buffer_size: 100)
    #     cbuf.write(Numo::SFloat[1,2,3])
    #     cbuf.read(2) # => Numo::SFloat[1,2]
    #
    # Multi-reader example:
    #
    #     cbuf = MB::Sound::CircularBuffer.new(buffer_size: 100)
    #     r1 = cbuf.reader
    #     r2 = cbuf.reader
    #     cbuf.write(Numo::SComplex[1i,2i,3i])
    #     r1.read(2) # => Numo::SComplex[1i,2i]
    #     r2.read(3) # => Numo::SComplex[1i,2i,3i]
    #     r1.read(1) # => Numo::SComplex[3i]
