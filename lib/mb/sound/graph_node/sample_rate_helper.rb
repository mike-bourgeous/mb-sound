      # Provides basic support for recursive sample rate changes on a node
      # chain.  Classes that want to support sample rate changes after
      # construction may start by including this module, then overriding the
      # sample_rate= method as needed (e.g. to recalculate durations or
      # counters that are sample-rate-specific).
      #
      # Only include this module if changing sample rates is supported by the
      # class.
      #
      # Example:
      #     class Z
      #       include SampleRateHelper
      #
      #       def sample_rate=(new_rate)
      #         @duration = @duration * new_rate / @sample_rate
      #         super
      #       end

        # positive number.
