      # Implements a 6th-order phase difference network that converts a
      # real-valued input signal to a complex-valued output signal with the
      # cosine and sine components of an analytic signal.  Both of these
      # components have some varying absolute phase shift relative to the input
      # signal, but a consistent relative phase shift of ~90 degrees relative
      # to each other.
      #
      # Thus this is not directly a Hilbert transform of the input signal, but
      # rather the sine output is the Hilbert transform of the cosine output,
      # both of which differ from the input signal by a frequency-varying
      # phase.
      #
      # The continuous-time pole frequencies in Hz were taken from CSound's
      # hilbertset function written by Sean M. Costello, which in turn were
      # taken from "Musical Engineer's Handbook" by Bernie Hutchins.  I then
      # converted them to angular frequencies to simplify the rest of the math,
      # and scaled them to get the best response from 20Hz to 20kHz.
