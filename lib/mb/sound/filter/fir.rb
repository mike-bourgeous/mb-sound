    class Filter
      # A simple implementation of FIR filtering using the FFT to perform
      # convolution.  Filter parameters are specified either as a Hash from
      # frequency to gain values, or as a Numo::NArray with positive FFT
      # coefficients of the desired frequency response.
      #
      # If a Hash frequency/gain map is specified, a naive filter design
      # algorithm will determine filter size (this could be improved) and
      # generate an FIR filter, interpolating between the specified
      # frequencies.  If the Hash does not contain a value for 0Hz or for the
      # Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate), then the slope of the
      # adjacent frequency/gain values will be extrapolated to 0Hz and/or
      # Nyquist as needed.
      #
      # The current filter size selection algorithm will choose a filter size
      # based solely on the closest-spaced frequencies in the gain map.  This
      # may be improved in the future to take slope into account.
      #
      # TODO: Allow specifying a time-domain impulse response
      # TODO: Add getters to return the processing delay, total delay, and impulse delay

      # Examples:
      #
      #     # Bass cut (added 200Hz so that extrapolated slope for Nyquist is flat)
      #     MB::Sound::Filter::FIR.new(gains: { 20 => -60.db, 100 => 0.db, 200 => 0.db)
      #
      #     # Phase rotation (the lower the frequencies and/or closer together, the
      #     # better the bass response)
      #     rotation = Complex.polar(1, Math::PI / 4)
