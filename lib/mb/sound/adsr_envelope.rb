    # An envelope generator with a traditional attack-decay-sustain-release
    # layout.  The envelope rises from 0 to +peak+ in #attack_time seconds when
    # #trigger(peak) is called, then decays to #sustain_level over #decay_time
    # seconds.  The envelope stays at #sustain_level until #release is called,
    # after which the envelope decays to 0 in #release_time seconds.  The
    # envelope is linearly interpolated using the smoothstep function.
    #
    # If the #release method is called before the #sustain_level is reached,
    # then the #release_time seconds decay will start at the envelope's current
    # level.
    #
    # This implementation may resuscitate decayed envelopes or end playing
    # notes if times are changed shortly after a note is released.  If I were
    # to reimplement this, I would use a state machine instead of comparing the
    # time value to switch between phases of the curve.
    #
    # Also, one notable difference between this implementation and other
    # possible implementations is that the times here are literal, while in an
    # exponential envelope the time value may be an exponential time constant
    # (time at which the decay is 1/e).
